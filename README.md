Heap review
All four subtasks were completed by Nathaniel Lavarwnay (worked this lab solo)
Subtask 1: Complete the code for heapify method in MaxHeapMaker class. This method takes in
an array of integers and returns a max-heap.
Subtask 2: Complete the code for delete method in MaxHeap class. This method removes the
maximum value in the tree and returns it.
Subtask 3: Complete the code for sort method in HeapSort class. This method takes in an array
of integers and returns the sorted array.
Subtask 4: If your team has a fourth member, the last member will complete the add method in
the class MaxHeap, otherwise leave it empty.
